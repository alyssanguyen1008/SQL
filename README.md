-- These SQL files are a part of project-based learning exercises I had a chance to practice during a 3-month bootcamp course at Wecloud Data. 
-- The 1st file "World Population" - I practiced how to create a new table and add or alter new variables or values to the database. 
-- Some SQL statements I learnt from this 1st dinclude CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, DESCRIBE, SELECT FROM WHERE
-- The 2nd dataset SQL - practice - I dig deeper into basic and intermediate SQL queries such as ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING and other aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG
-- I also learn INNER JOIN/LEFT JOIN that helps each row in the two joined tables to have matching column values.
